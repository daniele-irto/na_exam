This repository contains my solution to the exercises required as final project for the exam of the course "Numerical Analysis", 
held by professor Luca Heltai and Gianluigi Rozza during A.Y. 2020/2021.

**Note:** both files with `.ipynb` and `.py` contains the same code, I added the python script to allow for better versioning and comparison between commits 
with respect to the notebook version (thanks to [jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)).
